# Xander's Sodium Options

Xander's Sodium Options replaces the Sodium options GUI with a Minecraft-style alternative powered by Yet Another Config Lib.

It has a wide range of support for various mods which integrate with Sodium, such as:
-   [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris)
-   [Sodium Extra](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium-extra)
-   [More Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/moreculling)
-   [Cull Less Leaves](https://modrinth.com/mod/cull-less-leaves)
-   [EntityViewDistance](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-view-distance)

Any other mods which integrate with Sodium's GUI will *likely work* as well. If you encounter any issues, please [report them here!](https://github.com/isXander/xanders-sodium-options/issues)
